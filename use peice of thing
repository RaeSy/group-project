    <p> Walk along the Appian Way</p>
    <p>I wrote once before about why you must visit the Via Appia and how it was a perfect quiet space for ridding myself of jet lag after a long flight, yet I’d encourage anyone to take a bus to walk along the ancient road that points a straight route out of the city.
Green spaces and ancient monuments line both sides of the pathway and make for a pleasing scene if walked or biked along, especially for those looking for things to do in Rome for families or larger groups.</p>

    <P>Experience The Netherlands in 5D flight with This Is Holland</p>
      <P>the Netherlands is so much more than just Amsterdam. That is the idea behind the flight experience by This Is Holland. During the 9-minute flight, you will discover many must-see locations that you didn’t even know existed! I say this with full confidence: I saw impressed Dutchies exit This Is Holland as well. The flight experience is very well thought out: it feels like a great adventure, you get to feel the seawater spray, you get to breathe in the sweet smell of the flower fields, and you get to discover so many locations that will make you want to go beyond Amsterdam!</p>
